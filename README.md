## 👋 Yeah, it\'s Flingocho

## 🚀 About Me (blah, blah, blah...)

Currently a **Software Development Student** at the illustrious [**42 Madrid**](https://www.42madrid.com/). My thrilling coding escapade started in June 2024 with the "Piscine" (think trial by fire, but with more C code), and I officially subjected myself to the Cursus in September 2024.

These past few months have been... an experience. Mostly involving staring at a screen, questioning my life choices, and occasionally producing something resembling functional code. The goal is supposedly "elegant, high-performance code" and "thrilling projects." We'll see how that goes. 🙄

I document this questionable journey on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Flingocho). If you stumble upon my code and have actual, constructive advice (or just want to point and laugh), feel free. 🤷‍♂️
